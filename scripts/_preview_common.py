"""Shared primitives for the local Kaggle / HF preview-page scripts.

PR 7.2 — both ``scripts/preview_kaggle_page.py`` and
``scripts/preview_hf_page.py`` need to:

* HTML-escape user-controlled strings the same way (and emit the
  same entity form so committed sample HTML doesn't churn between
  scripts);
* construct an ``http.server.ThreadingHTTPServer`` rooted at a
  preview-output directory (chosen for ``allow_reuse_address=True``
  inheritance from ``HTTPServer``);
* start serving + optionally pop a browser tab.

Splitting ``make_server`` away from ``serve`` is what lets the test
suite stand the server up on port 0 in a thread, GET ``/``, and
shut down cleanly — the alternative (calling ``serve_forever``
directly) would require subprocess management and a real port
allocation race.
